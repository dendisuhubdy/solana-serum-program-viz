# Serum Dex

Simple diagram to explain the `NewOrderV3` instruction as done by [Serum Dex](https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex).

I didn't bother creating the other instructions, as this really is the most important/complex one. If you understand everything on this page, you understand Serum Dex.

JPEG below, PDF and XML file in the dir.

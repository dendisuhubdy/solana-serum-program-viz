# Solana & Serum Program Visualizations ðŸ‘€

A picture is worth a thousand words. This repo contains simple visualizations & diagrams to explain the inner workings of various solana & serum programs.

So far it has:

1. [Token Swap](https://spl.solana.com/token-swap)
2. [Token Lending](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-lending)
3. [Serum Dex](https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex) (only NewOrder instruction - but it is the main one)

I'm building these up as I'm learning the different programs. Given Solana's programming model which doesn't allow for variable sized storage in accounts, there can sometimes be a lot of accounts to deal with. Diagrams like these help a lot. 

Feel free to contribute. I've used draw.io to make these, but you can use whatever you want.
